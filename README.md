# Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

This code demonstrates how a gradient descent search may be used to solve the linear regression problem of fitting a line to a set of points. In this problem, we wish to model a set of points using a line. The line model is defined by two parameters - the line's slope m, and y-intercept b. Gradient descent attemps to find the best values for these parameters, subject to an error function.
